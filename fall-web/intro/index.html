                    I enjoy programming, working out, hiking, space, photographing landscapes, and writing.
                    I also very much enjoy film making and love going out to the cinema. One day I hope to write and direct a film of my own.
                    My influences include the obvious picks: Kubrick, Hitchcock, Scorsese, Tarantino, etc. But recently I have made it my goal to out and watch
                    films by lesser known film makers. I recently watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5691670/">"Under The Silver Lake"</a> by
                    David Robert Mitchell. Great film. Weird. But great. At this point I have no idea what else to say. Bye.
